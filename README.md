# Test Runner for Feed Reader
Udacity FEND P6

In this project, we have a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite.

This repo has updated the test suites to finish up the work that the original developer had begun.

## Running the app

1. Clone the repository to your machine
2. Load index.html in a web browser
